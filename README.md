# avl_tree
AVL tree exercise

- Implement AVL tree with find, insert, and delete
- Implement AVL tree using a set so that find checks if a value is present
- Use generics for the tree class so that any value with a comparable type can be used
- Don't allow duplicates
- Include a count method that runs in O(1)
- Have methods that return min and max vals
- Not including a method for range finding at this time
- Explore the performance for the insert operations in comparison with an unbalanced tree
